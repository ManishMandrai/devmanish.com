## 👨‍💻 About Me  
Hi, I’m **Dev Manish**, a Frontend Developer currently working at BoomXMedia.  
I build fast, responsive, and visually appealing interfaces using JavaScript and modern UI tools.  
I love creating web experiences that look great and feel smooth — from clean landing pages to complex dashboards and full-stack apps.

I enjoy working on:  
- Real-world MERN applications  
- Performance-optimized UI  
- Automation scripts  
- AI-integrated frontend features  
- Modern portfolio and product websites  

I’m open to **frontend, fullstack, and AI-powered UI roles**, remote or onsite.
